Yeah, same as mobile-first.
Main goal of that project is learn spring-security topic from basis to advanced and share with people.
Because no one enterprise application can't go live without security, I believe it should be done first.
It's also can help you avoid situation when application architecture needs to be refactored to have possibility to apply security to it...
I saw that many times...
For some reason, big part of software developers community do not care about security
from beginning or even to the end.
I think main reason is because security hard topic. And it's really sad - many developers want doing it right,
but for some reasons, people teaching them develop software missing security.
